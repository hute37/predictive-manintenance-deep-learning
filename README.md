# Predictive Maintenance using Keras in R

In this repositroy, we will show you how to perform predictive maintenance in R using keras package. This includes anomaly detection and fault classification. 

## Docker 
To develop this repository, I used `rocker/ml-gpu` image by rocker. I have tested this and works very well. All the dependencies are preloaded and you get a Rstudio server version as well.
